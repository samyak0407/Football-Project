    st.write("#### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning:")
    st.write("- Aggregated player statistics from reliable databases.")
    st.write("- Removed inconsistencies, standardized naming conventions, and handled missing values.")
    
    st.write("#### 2. Feature Engineering:")
    st.write("- Created unique metrics such as Expected Goal Contribution, Progressive Actions, and Fair Contribution Index.")
    st.write("- Developed position-specific impact factors for more accurate player evaluation.")
    
    st.write("#### 3. Adjusting Bias in Player Rankings:")
    st.write("- Traditional per 90-minute stats often overrate players with limited playtime.")
    st.write("- Implemented logarithmic and square-root transformation methods to balance player rankings and ensure fairness.")
    
    st.write("#### 4. Engaging Data Visualization:")
    st.write("- Used Plotly and Matplotlib for dynamic, interactive visualizations.")
    st.write("- Integrated heatmaps, sunburst charts, radar graphs, and trend analytics.")
    
    st.write("#### 5. Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling:")
    st.write("- Trained models to analyze future player performances and goal involvement probabilities.")
    st.write("- Used regression and clustering to forecast statistical trends across seasons.")
    
    st.write("#### 6. Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:")
    st.write("- Designed a fully functional, user-friendly interface to explore, compare, and analyze player statistics.")
    st.write("- Added squad, positional, and statistical filtering to allow personalized analysis.")
